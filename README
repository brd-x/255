DriverPass aims to fix the low pass rate in driving exams by suppling users with videos, practice tests and in person lessons.
I feel like I accurately described how the program should function on both the user and server levels by their respective diagrams.
Despite this, if I were to go back and fix things, I would work more on these diagrams and go into further detail.
I implemented the users needs by making my diagrams revolve around how the user will interact with the program, as well as how their data is transfered.
Considering the users needs is the biggest priority, perhaps the same as security, as the company and program will depend entirely on them.
